# joptsimple-annotations

The power of joptsimple with annotations instead of code.

## Goals

* Type safety: Parse arguments into models, making name and type mistakes compile-time errors.

* Simplicity: Reduce clutter and typing by assuming common cases.

* Flexibility: Annotations allow configuration of uncommon cases.
